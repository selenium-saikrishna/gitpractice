detect problems or bugs as early as posssible in the dev
life cycle

since the entire code base is integrated,built and tested 
constantly the potential bugs are errors are caught early
in the life cycle which results in quality software

stages in implementing continuous integration
1 automated build are scheduled on a regular basis.
2 build script compiles the application
  and runs a set of automated tests.
3 developers now commit their changes regularly
4 build servers would alert the team members in case
  of build failure


1 a build is triggered whenever new code is commited
  to the central repository
2 broken builds are usually treated as a high priority
  issue and are fixed quickly


Continuous integration
the practice of merging development work with the main branch
constantly

contnuous delivary
continuous delivary of the code to another enviromnet once 
the code is redy to ship.generally into pre-production servers
the idea is to deliver the product ot any user base
which can be QA or customer for review

continuous deployment
the deployment of release of code into production as
soon as the code is ready


Jenkins
it is a ci and build server
it is used to manually,periodiacally and automatically build 
software development projects
it is aci tools created in java
jenkins can be used for ci on projects creatred in different languages
 like java,c#,rubu,php etc


why jenkins is popular in ci
1 easy to use
2 highly extendable
