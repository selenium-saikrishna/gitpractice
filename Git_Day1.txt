Version Controlling
======================

Git and SVN are repositories which are used for version controlling.
Each developer or tester can upload his code in the Version controlling system
the version controller will accept the project uploads from various developers
and it will create one intgrated project out of these uploads

The process of uploading is called as checkin

The version controlling combines are this code and creates one project

When the developers download the code  from this version controlling system 
they will that it will contain all the work done by the complete team

It also maintains a track of all the older and latest versions

These systems are of two types
1 Centralised version controlling 
  eg: SVN

2 Distibuted version controlling
  eg: GIT

In centralised version controlling the complete repository is maintained on a 
 remote machine.Developers and testers can commit the code into this repository

In DVC repository is maintained on a remote server as well as on every developers 
machine.

The developer first commits his code into the local repository running 
on his machine.later it is uploaded into the remote repository


Downloading and installing GIT
===============================
1 Open https://git-scm.com/downloads
2 Download Git for windows
3 Install it

Once git is installed we get an application called GIT bash
This is the command prompt of git where we run git commands

Git Configuration commands
============================
user name and email id of developer should be configured into git
These setting will work for all the users accessing this machine

1 To configure username globally 
   git config --global user.name "Sai Krishna"

2 To configure email globally
   git config --global user.email "selenium.saikrishna@gmail.com"
3 To find the list of configuration details
   git config --list

Starting a repository
=======================
1 git init
  This will create a hidden folder called .git.Once this 
  folder is created we can start executing git commands

2 git status
  This will show the status of the repository

Working directory is the actual folder where 
 the code is present
From here code is sent into stagging area.All the files which
have come into stagging are called tracked files
From stagging area the code is sent into git local repository
where version controlling is done.This is called commiting

Git stagging commands
======================
1 To send one file into stagging area..ie it becomes a tracked file
	git add filename

2 To send multiple files into stagging area
       git add file1 file2 file3 file4

3 To send all the files present in the current directory
  into stagging area
       git add .

4  To remove a file from stagging area
	git reset filename
        git rm --cached filename

Commiting data into Local repository
=====================================
1 git commit -m "Some Message"
